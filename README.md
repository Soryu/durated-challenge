Durated Button Code Challenge
=============================

The challenge is to create a navigation button with six possible sections. Three of those will be simple modals and three will be navigation controllers. On tap five button appears with a nice animation of your choice (ref. myspace, path). Dragging the main button to one of the areas where the smaller buttons appear would trigger that button, and dragging half way would hint what button the user is approaching. Dragging/swiping right/left would cycle between the three navigation controllers with an appropriate animation. 

The actual controllers should just be simple placeholders. 

Grapic assets and mockups will be provided in this repo.
